# Assessment: Data Representation Coursework

by Sarah McNelis

<br>

## Introduction

This repository contains coursework and labs for Data Representation as part of my Higher Diploma in Computing in Data Analytics. 

<br>

## What to expect

This repository contains the following files:

- `library.xml` creates a library of two catalogues of books: technical books and cookery books using XML. 

- `assignment03-cso.py` retrieves a dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO. It stores this data into a json file called `cso.json`. 

- `assignment04-github.py` reads a file from a repository and replaces all the instances of the text "Andrew" with "Sarah". It then commits and pushes changes back to the repository. 

- `labs` is a folder which contains weekly ungraded labwork completed throughout the semester. 

<br>


## Credits

- For this project I heavely relied on my lecturer's notes. You can access his github repository [here](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/datarepresentation).
